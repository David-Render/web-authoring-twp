                It had been six months since we last changed the water filter, which was still within our usual eight-month cycle. 
                However, the water heating system had been acting up, cutting off hot water after just ten minutes. 
                This wasn’t just an inconvenience. It meant showers had to be rushed, and dishwashing became an unpredictable chore. 
                After dealing with this for weeks, we finally called a plumber, who suggested the simplest solution first: changing the filter.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="section-title">Changing the Filter</h2>

            <p>
                <img src="./images/filter.jpg" alt="Used Water Filter" class="totw-image">
                The process wasn’t exactly straightforward. We had to temporarily shut off the water, which meant we had to plan ahead. 
                Knowing that cleaning the filter’s container would be tough without running water, we filled a few buckets beforehand.
                We also needed some buckets to catch the water that was going to fall out of the system, which we learned the hard way the first time we changed the filter. 
                When we removed the old filter, we quickly realized why it needed changing. It was completely saturated, and water poured out of it. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once the filter was out, we took a closer look. It was a murky greyish-black, a clear indicator of months of accumulated sediment and impurities. 
                Cleaning the container itself was another challenge without the water. 
                Even though we had filled a few buckets ahead of time, scrubbing away the built-up residue was time-consuming. 
                After a bit of effort, we finally secured the new filter in place and turned the water back on.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="section-title">Aftermath</h2>
            <p>
                So, did it work? The heating improved, but not drastically. Instead of lasting only ten minutes, the hot water stretched to about twenty before cooling off. 
                While it wasn’t a perfect fix, it was a noticeable improvement. Considering we were due for a filter change anyway, it was worth it. 
                More interestingly, the overall water quality seemed slightly better. Maybe just a placebo effect, but the water felt a bit cleaner. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the end of the day, this filter had done its job, trapping months' worth of sediment and buildup. 
                It was a reminder of how much unfiltered gunk passes through our pipes without us even realizing it. 
                While we might have to dig deeper to fully fix the heating issue, at least we took a step in the right direction. 
                And next time, we won’t wait until the ten-minute shower countdown becomes unbearable.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="section-title">Disposal</h2>
            <p>
                After replacing the filter, we started wondering what to do with the old one. Simply throwing it in the trash felt wasteful, 
                so we contacted our local recycling center to see if they accepted used water filters. To our surprise, they did! 
                They explained that many household water filters contain recyclable materials, and they had a process in place to separate the plastic from the filtering media inside.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We were instructed to let the filter dry out completely before bringing it in. Once dried, we dropped it off at the facility, 
                where they would dismantle and process it for recycling. It was reassuring to know that instead of sitting in a landfill, 
                the plastic casing could be repurposed, and the internal materials would be disposed of properly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Recycling the filter turned out to be an easy and environmentally friendly choice. It was a small but meaningful step in reducing unnecessary waste, 
                and now we know what to do with future filters once they’ve run their course.

        <h2 class="section-title">The Trash of the Week Project</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Trash of the Week Project (TWP)</strong> is an initiative where I document and photograph nine discarded items each week, 
            avoiding food and drink-related waste. The focus is on unusual items—objects that are not commonly thrown away—so I can reflect on when, 
            where, and why I acquired and disposed of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is <strong>self-awareness</strong>: to prevent myself from going through life on autopilot. By taking time to analyze the objects I discard, 
            I learn about my consumption habits, the emotional significance of certain items, and the length of their usefulness.

        <h2 class="section-title">Philosophy of Waste</h2>
        <p>
            <em>“If someone you knew was going through your trash right now, it would make you comfortable with how much they could learn about you.”</em> – Sarah Newman
        </p>
        <p>
            The items we throw away reveal personal narratives, memories, and interests. Vik Muniz, in a New York Times article, 
            remarked: <em>“What we leave behind will mark our brief presence in history. If we care about how these items reflect upon us, 
            we will consider each purchase we make and each object we produce.”</em> His words highlight how our waste acts as a historical footprint, 
            shaping perceptions of our lives and times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Brian Thill expands on this by stating that modern waste is more than just an object’s end of life—it reflects our relationship with it. 
            <em>“Waste thus signifies something more than just a certain stage of an object’s life cycle; it is our specific affective relationship to an object that makes it ‘waste’ in the first place.”</em> 
            Trash tells stories beyond what we consciously recognize, and this project is a method to uncover those hidden truths.

        <h2 class="section-title">Changing Perspectives on Waste</h2>
        <p>
            Tracking and understanding waste doesn’t just offer personal insight—it can influence larger environmental behaviors. Dr. Roland Geyer, an environmental scientist, states: 
            <em>“I think that many people are actually quite horrified by the amount of plastic in their lives.”</em> Recognizing the waste we generate encourages reusability and conscious consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
            Artists like Steven Rodrig transform waste into art, using discarded circuit boards to create sculptures. He describes his approach as unique: 
            <em>“I love that whatever I create is the first of its kind since no other artist has attempted my approach to PCB sculpting (yet).”</em> 
            His work showcases how waste can take on new life beyond its intended use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even technology influences waste behavior. A study on a recycling app found that logging waste made users more mindful of their disposal habits, increasing recycling rates. 
            This parallels the TWP, where documentation fosters awareness and change.

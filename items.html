                <li><h4 class="item-title">Sponge</h4>
                    <p> I bought this sponge in a 6 pack a few months ago for my dishes. We have a dishwasher, but for small things that I need quick I just hand wash them instead of running the washer for just a couple small things. The sponge started to need more pressure to scrub off sticky things so I decided with the extra 5 I had to just replace it. The new sponge works great and the change was definitely worth it.</p>
                    <p> One interesting thing I’ve noticed about replacing sponges is how quickly they degrade over time without realizing it. This particular sponge was still intact but lost its scrubbing ability. Holding it next to a new one really showed how much it had thinned out from regular use.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4 class="item-title">Water Filter</h4>
                    <p> My house had a problem with water heating and before calling a plumber, I decided to change the filter to see if it would change anything. The process was a kind of a pain dealing with the leftover water in the system and washing the container of the filter. I bought a pack of 2 last time I changed it and had the extra filter on hand. The change did help with the heat quite substantially and overall glad I did it.</p>
                    <p> What I found most interesting about replacing the water filter was the buildup it had accumulated. The old one had a brownish tint, showing just how much sediment was trapped over time. While replacing it was a minor inconvenience, it was also a reminder of how much unseen dirt passes through everyday water use.</p>

                <li><h4 class="item-title">Cardboard Box</h4>
                    <p> This box came with a delivery that I can't remember what was for. I used this box to hold small items I had to pack around my room while we got new windows in my room. The construction lasted only a couple days but I forgot to replace the items until this last week.</p>
                    <p> It’s always surprising how cardboard boxes find second and third uses. This one was originally just packaging but ended up being a temporary storage container. Even though it was ultimately thrown out, it had already served multiple purposes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4 class="item-title">Resort Passport</h4>
                    <p> After I rented my snowboard for the 2019-2020 season, the place I rented from gave me a coupon book for local ski mountains. They called this book the "Resort Passport" and I stuffed it somewhere around the house. I recently found it after doing a deep sort of my papers stack where I keep trivial papers.</p>
                    <p> The most disappointing part about throwing this out was that I never used it. I had the opportunity but completely forgot about it. It’s a reminder of how many things we accumulate but never fully take advantage of.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4 class="item-title">Tree Branch</h4>
                    <p> While this isn't a paper item, technically it's what paper is made out of and this section fits best. Some branches fell off during a snowstorm and this one was the most interesting-looking branch. It looks like a mini tree with sub-branches and needles (leaves) at the end. This is the only item that I decomposed in our local decomposer bin.</p>
                    <p> What fascinated me about this branch was how it resembled a fully grown tree in miniature form. It made me appreciate nature’s patterns, how even small pieces can mimic the structure of something much larger.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4 class="item-title">Weird Bookmark</h4>
                    <p> This also isn't a paper item, but it's used with paper being a bookmark so I'm putting it in the paper section. My little brother got this bookmark at his school's book fair. It's made of rubber and oddly satisfying to play around with, probably some kind of fidget toy. The rubber started to become hard, like an old rubber band, so we decided to throw it in the trash.</p>
                    <p> This was one of those items that just slowly stopped being useful. It wasn’t sudden, but one day we just realized it wasn’t flexible anymore. It’s odd how some things feel like they’ll last forever until one day they don’t.</p>

                <li><h4 class="item-title">Cola Can</h4>
                    <p> Last week I bought a 12-pack of cola cans and I didn't notice until I got home that a corner of the box had a dried cola stain. When opening the box, I found this can inside completely exploded. I was able to get a refund from the grocery store and keep the rest of the box on top of that.</p>
                    <p> I don’t know how the can got damaged, but seeing a fully destroyed soda can in a sealed box was surprising. The remaining liquid had evaporated, leaving behind dried residue. It’s a strange thing to see something packaged and new already be ruined before it was ever used.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4 class="item-title">Penguin Plushy</h4>
                    <p> I came home yesterday to find a penguin plushy that I bought a while ago for my niece chewed up by my dog. The nose is missing as well as the tail in the back (not shown in the photo). I was kind of sad that the toy was destroyed but thankfully it's not the only toy I got for my niece.</p>
                    <p> My dog seems to have a preference for destroying plush toys. This wasn’t the first, and it won’t be the last. It’s funny how dogs seem to have an instinct to chew specific things while leaving others alone. Even though it was sad to see it torn apart, it at least provided some entertainment before meeting its end.</p>

            <p>
                Every week, I take some time to look at the things I throw away. It’s not just about keeping track of what I’m getting rid of, but about understanding why these items are leaving my life in the first place. 
                Trash of the Week isn’t about everyday waste. 
                It’s about objects that once had a purpose, things I used, held onto, or forgot about, and why their time is finally up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I focus on nine discarded items each week, avoiding food and drink related waste. 
                Instead I document unusual objects, things that might have had sentimental value, served a practical purpose, or simply sat unused for too long. 
                By doing this, I can look back at when and why I got them, how they fit into my daily life, and what made me decide to let them go.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project is about paying attention. 
                It’s easy to accumulate stuff and toss things out without much thought. 
                But when I stop to think about what I’m throwing away, I start to see patterns. 
                Some things were well used, others were impulse buys, and a few were gifts that never really fit into my life. 
                Every item has a small story to tell. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The things we throw away say a lot about us. 
                They reflect our habits, our priorities, and even our emotions. 
                By documenting my trash, I’m hoping to be more intentional with what I own, what I keep, and what I choose to let go.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="about-section-title">Why This Matters</h3>
            
            <p>
                The <strong>Trash of the Week Project (TWP)</strong> is more than just a record of discarded objects. 
                It’s an initiative where I document and photograph discarded items each week, with a deliberate effort to avoid food and drink related waste. 
                The focus is on unusual, but daily use, items so I can reflect on when, where, and why I acquired and disposed of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its core, this project is about <strong>self awareness</strong>. 
                It’s easy to go through life on autopilot, accumulating things without considering their long term value. 
                By taking time to analyze the objects I discard, I gain insight into my consumption habits, the emotional significance of certain items, and the length of their usefulness. 
                Every discarded item tells a story, not just about the object itself, but about my choices, priorities, and evolving perspective on material possessions.

            <p>
                <em>“If someone you knew was going through your trash right now, it would make you comfortable with how much they could learn about you.”</em> – Sarah Newman
            </p>
            <p>
                The items we throw away reveal personal narratives, memories, and interests. 
                Also it shows how we keep/treasure our trash by the state it leaves us in.
                Vik Muniz, in a New York Times article, remarked: 
                <em>“What we leave behind will mark our brief presence in history. If we care about how these items reflect upon us, we will consider each purchase we make and each object we produce.”</em> 
                He highlights how our waste acts as a historical footprint, shaping perceptions of our lives and times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brian Thill expands on this by explaining that modern waste is more than just an object’s end of life, it reflects our relationship with it. 
                <em>“Waste thus signifies something more than just a certain stage of an object’s life cycle; it is our specific affective relationship to an object that makes it ‘waste’ in the first place.”</em> 
                Trash tells stories beyond what we consciously recognize, and this project is a method to uncover those hidden truths.

            <p>
                Tracking and understanding waste doesn’t just offer personal insight, it can influence larger environmental behaviors. 
                Dr. Roland Geyer, an environmental scientist, states: 
                <em>“I think that many people are actually quite horrified by the amount of plastic in their lives.”</em> 
                Recognizing the waste we generate encourages reusability and conscious consumption. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Artists like Steven Rodrig transform waste into art, using discarded circuit boards to create sculptures. 
                He describes his approach as unique: 
                <em>“I love that whatever I create is the first of its kind since no other artist has attempted my approach to PCB sculpting (yet).”</em> 
                His work showcases how waste can take on new life beyond its intended use. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even technology influences waste behavior. 
                Now a days, theres even recycling apps that allow users to log waste making them more mindful of their disposal habits and increasing recycling rates. 
                This parallels the TWP, where documentation fosters awareness and change.

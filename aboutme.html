                Hi! I'm David Render, and I'm the creator of <strong>Trash of the Week</strong>. 
                I am a Senior at Rutgers University with a passion for Computer Science and Math.
                I hope to move to getting a Master's in ML or a related field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of this project, I enjoy being physically active like snowboard, rock climbing, calisthenics, etc. 
                Iâ€™m always looking for new things to try and add a little bit of spice to my daily routine.
                I find myself sometimes bored which is why I am willing to try almost everything and anything that sounds interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also working on a few projects to get my ground in the ML field and some side project to improve my overall coding and logic skills.
                When challening myself with project, I find the satisfaction of completeing a task that took months of work almost exhiliration.
            </p>
            <p>
                If have any questions or recommendations of things to try, feel free to reach out through Github or the email linked.
